                <h2>Japan Airlines jet burst into flames after collision with quake-relief plane</h2>
                <p> Five people were killed when a Japan Airlines plane carrying hundreds of passengers collided with an earthquake relief aircraft and burst into flames on landing at Tokyo’s Haneda airport on Tuesday.<br><br>
                    
                    All 379 people on JAL flight 516, including eight children under the age of two, were safely evacuated from the passenger plane, according to the airline, but there were fatalities on the second aircraft, operated by the Japan Coast Guard.<br><br>
                    
                    The Airbus A350-900 aircraft ignited after flying into Haneda from the northern Japanese city of Sapporo at 5:47 p.m. local time (3:47 a.m. ET). Video showed a huge fireball erupt as the plane ignited, leaving a fiery trail down the runway.<br><br>
                    
                    Five crew members died on the second aircraft, a De Havilland Canada DHC-8, according to Japan’s transport minister, Tetsuo Saito. Public broadcaster NHK said the plane’s captain was in a critical condition. </p>

                <h2>Ukraine claims it destroyed Russian tank landing ship </h2>
                <p> Ukraine claimed on Tuesday to have carried out an airstrike in Crimea that destroyed a Russian Navy tank landing ship in what would be, if confirmed, the third instance of major losses of Russian military hardware in less than a week.<br><br>

                    In a post on Telegram, Ukrainian Air Force commander Mykola Oleshchuk thanked personnel involved in “the destruction of the Novocherkassk large landing ship” while it was in the port of Feodosia in Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula illegally annexed by Russia in 2014.<br><br>
                    
                    CNN cannot independently verify the claim, but videos posted on social media showed large explosions in the Feodosia port.<br><br>
                    
                    The Russian Defense Ministry said the Novocherkassk had been “damaged” in a Ukrainian attack in a statement reported by the state-run TASS news agency. </p>

                <h2>Israel’s top court strikes down key part of judicial overhaul, reigniting divisions as war rages </h2>
                <p> Israel’s Supreme Court on Monday struck down a controversial government plan to limit the powers of the judiciary, in an unprecedented move that reignited fierce tensions in the country as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wages war against Hamas in Gaza.<br><br>

                    The court ruled, by eight votes to seven, that a government amendment to the so-called reasonableness law should not stand. The bill had stripped the Supreme Court of the power to declare government decisions unreasonable, and was the first major piece of a multipronged effort to weaken the judiciary to be passed by the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, last year.<br><br>
                    
                    The verdict reopened an emotional and heated debate that had raged in Israel throughout 2023 but was sidelined following Hamas’ attacks on October 7. And it could cause splits within Israel’s war cabinet, made up of Netanyahu and two prominent critics of his efforts to overhaul the courts. </p>

                    While thousands of migrants enter the US illegally every day, more than 11,000 people continue to wait in shelters and camps on the Mexican side of the border, CNN has learned from community leaders. With Washington divided on the future of US immigration policy, those waiting migrants and asylum seekers still hope to enter the US through legal pathways established by the Biden administration.<br><br>
                    
                    In Tijuana, Mexico, across the border from San Diego, California, an estimated 3,800 migrants from countries like Mexico, Cuba, Haiti, and Venezuela are staying in shelters, according to municipal migration affairs director Enrique Lucero. In Reynosa, Mexico, across the border from McAllen, Texas, another 3,273 migrants are waiting at Senda De Vida shelters, according to pastor Hector Silva, who runs the facilities. And in nearby Matamoros, Mexico, about 4,000 migrants are living in camps, shelters, and abandoned homes, says Glady Cañas who runs nonprofit Ayudandoles a Triunfar. </p>

                <p> 

                    South Korea’s main opposition party leader Lee Jae-myung is recovering from surgery after being stabbed in the neck during a visit to the southern city of Busan on Tuesday.<br><br>
                    
                    Lee underwent a vein reconstruction surgery and is recovering in the intensive care unit, Democratic Party spokesperson Kwon Chil-seung said.<br><br>
                    
                    Lee was touring the construction site of the Gadeokdo New Airport and talking to reporters when he was attacked, leaving the politician with a 1-centimeter laceration on the left side of his neck, Kwon said in an earlier statement. <br><br>

                <h2>The year’s most extreme weather shows what a warming planet is capable of, and what’s to come </h2>
                <p> In the hottest year on record, the fingerprints of a changing climate in a warming world were all over dozens of extreme weather events.<br><br>
                    
                    There wouldn’t be weather without heat; heat is energy, and weather is an expression of that energy, of an atmosphere trying to balance itself. But too much heat in the system raises the limits of what is possible in weather and pushes it toward the extremes.<br><br>
                    
                    So it’s maybe no surprise then that this year’s record heat was a “through line” in many of 2023’s most brutal weather events, Kristina Dahl, climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, told CNN.<br><br>
                    
                    “Climate change influences our weather on Earth every day,” Dahl said. “In my mind, the burden of proof now is to show that climate change hasn’t influenced an event, because it’s just so clearly influencing everything around us.” </p>

                <h2>Inside the $760M restoration of Notre Dame cathedral </h2>
                <p> The spire of Notre Dame, crowned by a brand new golden rooster, regained its place in the Paris skyline last week.<br><br>

                    As tourists and Parisians gathered outside the UNESCO-listed cathedral to admire the return of one of its most emblematic features — for now, still encased in scaffolding — the Notre Dame worksite remained in full swing. Nearly 500 craftspeople are busy with rebuilding efforts, working to ensure the Parisian landmark is ready for its grand reopening to the public less than a year from now.<br><br>
                    
                    “It’s fascinating to see how something of such historical value is being restored,” said Stephan Book, a tourist visiting Paris from Sweden with his daughter and 80-year-old father. “And the ambition to do it all in five years,” he added, “It’s like when Kennedy said (humans) were going to the moon.” </p>

                <p> 

                    Rafael Nadal made an impressive return to singles action on Tuesday as he beat Austria’s Dominic Thiem in straight sets at the Brisbane International in Australia.<br><br>
                    
                    The 22-time grand slam champion was playing in his first singles match in almost a year, having spent months struggling with injuries last season.<br><br>
                    
                    “Today is honestly an emotional and important day for me after probably one of the toughest years of my tennis career without a doubt,” Nadal said in his on-court interview after the first-round win. </p>

                <p> Dr. Kwane Stewart — a veterinarian whose nonprofit, Project Street Vet, provides medical care to the pets of people experiencing homelessness — is the 2023 CNN Hero of the Year.<br><br>

                    Online voters selected him from among this year’s Top 10 CNN Heroes.<br><br>
            
                    “I’ve wanted to be a veterinarian my whole life, since I was a child,” Stewart said when accepting the award. “I’m so lucky to be doing what I’m doing.”<br><br>
            
                    Stewart’s outreach on the streets started more than a decade ago. On a whim, the veterinarian stopped to examine the dog of a homeless man outside a 7-11 where he got his coffee. </p>

                <h2>Argentina presidential election heading to run-off with Massa leading Milei </h2>
                <p>  The battle to decide who will run crisis-wracked Argentina is heading to a run off vote next month between left wing candidate Sergio Massa and far right libertarian Javier Milei, according to data released by Argentina’s National Electoral Chamber after the first round of voting on Sunday.<br><br>
                    
                    After polls closed Massa received the highest number of votes – 8,877,325, accounting for 36.33% of the total, data revealed. Milei received 7,373,876 votes – roughly 30.18%.<br><br>
                    
                    Third place candidate Patricia Bullrich got 23.82% and conceded defeat late Sunday night.
                    
                    Each is vying for the nation’s trust at a moment of widespread disillusionment with the country’s elite and its management of the country. </p>
