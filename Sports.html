                <h2>ICC suspension triggers Sri Lanka sports law reforms</h2>
                <p>Sri Lanka would soon come up with a new sports law that aims to eliminate political interference in the administration of the governing body, SLC.<br><br>

                    A cabinet sub committee appointed by President Ranil Wickremesinghe in November last year has reported back to him last Monday with the necessary recommendations.<br><br>
                    
                    The committee came to be appointed after the then sports minister Roshan Ranasinghe’s action to appoint an interim committee to run SLC in a blatant violation of the ICC’s governance rules for member country administrations.</p>
