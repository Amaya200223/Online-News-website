                <h2>Policy Statement by Honourable Ranil Wickremesinghe President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka At the inauguration of the 5th session of the 9th Parliament of Sri Lanka 07-02-2024</h2>
                <p>

                    From ancient times to the present day, our world has encountered a myriad of crises, spanning nations and personal lives alike. While some crises could be overcome, others proved insurmountable. Mere condemnation and blame-shifting towards the crisis itself and not moving beyond scrutinizing its root causes are not effective means of resolution.<br.<br>
                    
                    Successful crisis management, whether on a global scale, within nations, or in individual lives, hinges on adeptly handling the situation and navigating through it. Reflecting on the timeless wisdom of Lord Buddha’s sermon, ‘Attadeepa – Viharati’—be a lamp unto you—we find a profound lesson. Initiating the process of overcoming a crisis must begin within oneself. Throughout history, no crisis has been conquered solely through pointing fingers at others.</p>
