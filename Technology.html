                <h2>SLT sale hit a roadblock because it’s suing Dialog’s Airtel acquisition</h2>
                <p> The sale of SLT’s 50.23% stake has hit a bump in the road owing to Mobitel’s ongoing court case against the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL). A few months ago, the state enterprise took the regulator to court in opposition to the proposed acquisition of Airtel Sri Lanka by Dialog Axiata, citing monopoly concerns.<br><br>

                    Back in May, Dialog Axiata announced that it was acquiring Airtel Sri Lanka as part of a cash and share swap deal. As per the binding term sheet, Bharti Airtel would gain a stake in Dialog that would reflect the fair value of Airtel Lanka. Dialog indicated that finalized agreements were yet to be signed at the time, with TRC’s Acting General Director Helarisi Ranatunga stating that the regulator has yet to grant approval. </p>

                <h2>Building the Digital Core: The Blueprint for Digital Transformation</h2>
                <p>n continuation of my previous article, Three Steps to Deliver Rich Digital Experiences, let’s now take a deeper dive into the crux of digital transformation: the digital core. As a technical decision-maker, it’s essential to recognize that nurturing a robust digital core goes beyond technology adoption. It involves establishing a dynamic ecosystem that synergizes technology, people, and architecture. Doing so is not a luxury or an optional step in your digital journey—it’s an absolute necessity.<br><br> It serves as the fulcrum upon which digital transformation leverages its capabilities, creating ripple effects that permeate throughout the organization. Without a fortified digital core, even the most sophisticated digital strategies may find themselves hamstrung, unable to realize their full potential for catalyzing long-term, transformational change.</p>

                <p>Conversations around Artificial Intelligence continues to ramp up over the past few years. This is particularly true considering how the sector is increasingly getting ingrained in today’s society. In such a context, it’s vital that discussions continue exploring the many opportunities the field has to offer. <br><br>The AIESEC in SLIIT is looking to emulate that through the IntelliCon ’22 event. It’s an AI-focused conference with the idea of inspiring enthusiasts towards actionable usecases and data-driven solutions. The overarching theme aims to bring together all stakeholders ranging from undergraduates and researchers to industry professionals. </p>

                <h2>All about AI and Pixel: Key announcements from Google IO 2023.</h2>
                <p>It’s the season of AI and Google really wants you to know how serious the company is about the space. Google wasted no time running through its slew of AI-enabled products and services at Google IO 2023. Of course, it wasn’t all AI as the tech giant also had a few interesting additions to the Pixel lineup. So here are the highlights from this year’s Google keynote.<br><br>
                    The first big announcement for Google was the launch of PaLM 2, the latest version of the company’s own Large Language Model (LLM). Detailing its capabilities, Google claims that it offers better multilingual reasoning and that it has “improved its ability to understand, generate and translate nuanced text.” Further, the latest version of the LLM comes with an improved understanding of programming, logic, and mathematics among other things.</p>

                <h2>SLT is teasing free data and higher speeds for broadband users</h2>
                <p>With 2024 almost here, SLT appears to be prepping for a new home broadband offering. The telecom operator recently shared teasers about “a new home broadband experience” on social media. SLT followed this up hinting “unlimited internet” and “free data.” The company further indicated that existing broadband users may get free unlimited data and higher download/upload speeds. It’s worth taking things with a grain of salt, particularly given the history of internet service providers’ marketing practices. Nevertheless, SLT’s teasers already appear to have piqued general consumer interest. <br><br>
                    Coincidentally, several SLT fiber connection owners recently reported unusually high speeds, with download rates inching close to 1Gbps. The high speeds only lasted for a day, followed by SLT’s ambiguous teasers on an upcoming broadband package on social media. While the telco has yet to provide concrete details, many now speculate that the speeds in question were in fact a test run and that consumers could likely expect a new gigabit fiber offering in some form. </p>

                <h2>Voice and image-based ChatGPT prompts are here</h2>
                <p>IIn its latest update, OpenAI announced that it’s rolling out voice and images to ChatGPT. Users will not be able to utilize voice and image-based prompts along with text on the popular AI bot. The new features will be available within the next couple of weeks to Plus and Enterprise users of the service.<br><br>

                    Similar to Siri or Google Assistant, you can prompt ChatGPT with your voice. Here, the bot will convert it to text, process it through its Large Language Model, and form an audio response. The feature is part of OpenAI’s efforts to build more audio capabilities for its tools and services. The company states that its voice tech can create “realistic synthetic voices from just a few seconds of real speech” and its voice chat feature comes as a means of mitigating potential risks.</p>

                <h2>SL government emails lose data with no backups due to “administrative problems”</h2>
                <p>A recent report from The Sunday Times claims that all Sri Lanka government emails (gov.lk domain) have lost data owing to a ransomware attack. According to the ICTA, the data in question falls between 17th May to 26th August 2023 with around 5,000 email addresses impacted by the ransomware. To make matters worse, the ICTA also admits that there’s no backup available to restore the lost data.<br><br>

                    The ransomware attack took place on 26 August morning and affected all of Lanka Government Network’s (LGN) gov.lk emails. While the system was eventually restored within 12 hours of the attack, none of the lost email data was recovered as the ransomware’s encryption affected the online backups as well. </p>
